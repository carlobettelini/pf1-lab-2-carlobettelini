For this assignment you can use any Git client; however, we recommend *against* using the `git` command-line client unless you are already familiar with command-line tools on macOS or Linux. The instructions below refer to Github Desktop.

1. Create an account in [`github.com`](http://github.com).

2. Download and install [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), or use another Git client.

3. Clone the assignment repository. If you're reading this, you should have already done this!

4. Create a text file named `Hello.txt` containing your name.

5. Add `Hello.txt` to the repository.

6. Commit `Hello.txt` with the comment "`saying hello`".

7. Modify `Goodbye.txt` to change the word `Buy!` to `Bye!`.

8. Commit `Goodbye.txt` with the comment "`fixed spelling`".

9. Push your changes.
